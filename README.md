#### User Stories (3 Points):
Henrietta is a restauranteur whose franchise is growing rapidly. She wants her employees to be able to learn from her top-secret recipes, as well as share their own, no matter where they're located. To accomplish, this, Henrietta has requested a recipes wiki. Users need to be able to log in with password authenication and then read all the existing articles and create new articles, as needed. Each article will display which user created it, and when it was last edited, by whom. Users are also able to add tags to each recipe, which they can then use to browse additional articles.

Secondary requirements include comments, printer-friendly view, and search functionality (none are implemented in this version).
